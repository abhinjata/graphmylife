A common wonderment in our further graduate-level education is the inclusion of English as a course in the curriculum. Most people scoff and give it minimal priority, while others celebrate the “free marks”.  

The truth is that language is one of mankind’s most beautiful and powerful creations for two reasons. The first reason stands as the fact that English is not any less than it’s other logical brethren; English requires logical comprehension skills and understanding yet, the true beauty lies in the second reason.  

There are many ways we interpret and understand this universe – using sciences like Physics, Chemistry, Biology with a powerful tool like Mathematics – yet, none of these sciences hold the power of emotional understanding and communication that languages offer. We pursue conquests of scientific greatness understanding, trying to get as technical and logically cold as we can, but we forget that although these subjects give us the logical goodness, English, the universal language, gives us ability to feel emotions.  

All languages – no matter if its English, French, Hindi or the thousand others – are beautifully constructed in a magically perfect way such that these tools, when used by some of the greatest minds, can be sung in the form of a beautiful song or can be life-altering in the form of a complex philosophy which can touch the hearts of masses. The power words possess in languages are greater than what mankind can see but is intrinsically known by everybody. No matter how the ages evolve with upcoming new technologies, there will never be a creation that will be as emotionally intelligent and beautiful as language.  

“Medicine, law, business, engineering. These are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, literature, romance and love are what we stay alive for.”
