My father once said that clearing misconceptions comes from one single step which mankind fails to understand the importance of – define.  Definition of a certain idea or thought gives us the power to bring a group of people, of any scale, together. We have always been aware of “defining something” due to our respective education system’s importance in questioning with the word “define” but, have we understood the real importance behind their intentions of making people hone such a skill of definition so thoroughly from when we enter our schooling?  

The word “define” can be a simple synonym to “elaborate” or “explain”, but specifically the word “define” holds a larger meaning. Rise of Communism, a great historical era in the late 1900s, was seen as the inception of a new thought process where the lower working class looked for ways to achieve equality in their own perception. Left-winged politics and Right-winged politics are stark contrast definitions of themselves. Left-winged follows the mindset of “slave morality” and Right-winged politics follows the mindset of “master morality”. Slave Morality, as elaborated by Mark Mason, is the perspective of less fortunate men to justify the need for equality on a basis of sympathy, i.e., “we must be treated equality because we are less abled than the higher class”. Whereas, Master Morality is a mindset based of a perception of a god complex where the capitalist society justifies the inequality they bring with all deserving, i.e., “we have worked for this and we deserve it.” According to Nietzsche, these logical ideologies were to bring chaos into this world. In other words, Nietzsche was afraid that as soon as there was no longer a common definition, purpose, or goal; the world was bound to fall apart. He was right; revolutions had begun, society split. Communism, Socialism, Democracy, Monarchy, Liberalism, a bunch of other bullshit. Definition failed, society failed. 

Even in the current world, it is very apparent that problems arise on different perspectives: race inequality, gender inequality, people going for land masses they think they deserve, etc. The world is divided, but why? A lack of common definition. Yes, it is impossible to bring all man under one god or cut all borders and scream with your pants off that war is over but, we have come to embrace our differences which we now call “religion” and “culture”.  

Definition, is far more impactful under the lens of business psychology, leadership, mediation, law, etc. Definition or more precisely, common definition, sets aside all misconceptions and prejudices. To run a team, be it salesmen or engineers, they must have what is called a common definition when it comes to any impediment or problem. A common definition can be broken down into sub-categories – (A) Common Purpose, (B) Common Goal, (C) Common Solution.  

A common purpose is very familiar to us, though we may not recognize it but, this is essentially the “mission statement” which is printed all over a company handbook. This brand statement is more than just a marketing strategy, it is an idea which unites a group of people with the same ambitions. “To empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more” is the brand statement of Microsoft, one that has been rightfully followed. Bill Gates leading by example when he invested insane amounts of money into Apple, albeit, to avoid Microsoft from becoming a monopoly but you get the point. There’s no such thing as a selfless good deed. Back to the point, common purpose is something that brings us together, under the same thought process.  

A common goal is a micro-version of common purpose, where after the purpose is stapled, we break it down into tangible and achievable goals which aids to live up to the purpose set. This is essentially the manifestation of your own visualization of your faith.  

A common solution, the trickiest one for all leaders, is to communicate a plan. A solution. This is to be done with the communication of all personnel involved in the impediment of a certain project. Though it sounds like it would require mediation and a hefty process, definition is more free flowing.  

As a leader, you must reiterate the definition of what the team is working towards. Another twist, this may not even require a team. Definition is crucial in our day-to-day one-on-one conversations too. If a person is not on the same thought process as you, broadly define it. The broader and united approach of common definition to get people into your thought process of thinking is a bit under the psychology of persuasion, as well as leadership.  

Affirmations, to remind you where you visualize yourself to be in 5 years’ time, a common technique of motivation, follows the principle of definition. You define yourself, you’re free. Definition is the simplest term with the broadest meaning to aid in any form of communication with oneself, one another, or a group of people. A country, or a group of office workers. Definition, is the key principle behind the psychology of communication.
