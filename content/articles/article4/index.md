While choosing the ideal career path, an individual must cater to the mind’s most challenging questions. These questions define you as a person and which path is right for you as an individual – which path is right for your own personality. One individual may find their people skills to be the most valuable trait in them, hence, choosing a career in Law or Sales. While other individuals may vary, believing that their most priced trait in the current job market would be their mathematical and computation skills, hence, choosing to follow a path in engineering, etc.  

There lies another question while choosing which field of work you want to make yours. A field of work which is your craft; something you will hone to the end of your days. The question we must ask ourselves before making such a monumental decision is: am I contributing to the making of art?  

Purpose and meaning behind a way of craft is truly one of the most important details one must consider. This is so crucial that, in fact, many companies such as Tech Mahindra, Apple, Microsoft, etc., believe that key reason behind their success is their ability to instill a deep sense of meaning behind every individual’s work in their company. They make it known that what they do, is creating a piece of art for the world to become a better place. In a dated interview with Anand Mahindra, the CEO of the Mahindra Group; he remarks that what Tech Mahindra excels and focus on, is the ability to provide a sense of meaning and purpose in every one of their individuals. By such instance, the leadership at Mahindra are proven to be crucial into integrating this major aspect.  

The question still remains unanswered, how? How do individuals find such meaning in their work? The simple answer is, every individuals with artistic traits would argue that; they chose their career path because they see it as a work of art. Enough beating around the bush, let us answer what art is in career.  

Art, involves the creation of an idea. An idea born from a set of bright minds, after which, is incubated and worked on by a handful of brilliant individuals who take a canvas and start painting their idea. The creation of an idea from start to end, simply is a work of art. With innovation and meaning sprinkled in, there’s no career path that cannot be epitomized a work of art. Every individual is working a piece of art, we all are in involved in the creation of something bigger than us. This something bigger than us has a bigger meaning and the entire world around it, with a vision capable of exceeding our perspectives. When you work on such an idea, who can stop you from calling yourself an artist?
