Solitude, a word synonymous to independence and individuality. Solitude is mistreated and related to two different emotions of the human mind – loneliness and being alone. Solitude, therefore, refers to being alone. One who enjoys a state of singularity, understands its worth. Solitude is the greatest gift to a man, solitude has the power to fix and heal anything. A state of solitude allows the flow of ideas, thoughts and emotions. When in a mental state of distress, one is advised to seek solitude, for it allows one to bring in a crucial stage of grief and distress – acceptance.  

The flow of thoughts and emotions comes with the acceptance of these thoughts, a true state of solitude is achieved in peace and calmness. Solitude is achieved when you let emotions flow and be accepted as one of you in that very moment, which can then be dealt with in a problem solving state of mind. Solitude allows for such enlightenment. As such, this is the true meaning of solitude, one cannot truly describe anything chaotic as solitude for it is negative and solitude is in a state of utter peace and positivity or neutrality.   

Solitude is a state of mind, allowing the peaceful flow of thoughts with no barricades and impediments hurdling the flow of the mind. Solitude allows for the creation of great ideas, when the mind is a blank canvas and is being painted on in this state. Thoughts, ideas, passion, etc., thrive in this state. Solitude shouldn’t be confused with ideating either, since solitude is broadly just a peaceful state of individuality, solitude lets us connect to ourselves on a deeper level and understand the workings of our mind. You can only sense a state of solitude, it is one of the most beautiful creations of the human mind aside from understanding the beauty of mundane things – the sun, the moon, the trees young and old. Things of beauty.
