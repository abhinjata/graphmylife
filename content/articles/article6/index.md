Introspection defines the ability of self-understanding and the realization of intrinsic abilities. Introspection can be referred to as a major skill in this current generation of volatility (ups-and-downs) and essentially offers individuals to define everything about themselves. In a previous article, I spoke on the importance and meaning behind the term  ‘define’, which personally, stands to have immense value and importance for me in my understanding and ideologies of everything and anything. I relate the ability of introspection to the definition of within, which is non-negotiable, the most important domain of understanding we require of. The human mind is a complex piece of working, and decoding such a magnificent creation is our own responsibility. Before the learning of any major subject or specializing in a field of study, one must first begin with self-enlightenment and then, move to enlightening themselves by the world.  

Introspection is key, it is understandable, but why? Simple, yet intricate question which breaks all boundaries and leaks into subjects of psychology. I will now refer to introspection as an act rather than an innate ability embedded in humans, though it’s true; logically, humans have been gifted everything, the same way as the ability of introspection, and we must hone this ability with understanding and actions to become more. The process of honing and using your introspection is an act, and this act is thoroughly crucial to make it far in daily life – not only to be successful, but to be happy.  

When one introspects the understanding and thought process of one’s own mind, it creates a sense of clarity due to definition. Defining your own wants and needs are crucial to introspection. A key element of introspection is the timeline – the past, the present and the future. The past allows us to introspect on the mistakes and lessons learnt in an incident while also being grateful for the opportunities and positive events that also took place which, being compared to the past at that point in time, would resemble growth, which kicks in the incentive and growth mindset allowing us to want more.  

Then comes the present; the present is the analysis of your current feelings, allowing for there to be acceptance. Acceptance is the key to introspection of the present; accept your emotions, wants, needs, desires. Introspection also requires honesty to oneself. With this honesty, people can then extract all the possible information and emotions on themselves which allows for them to truly be at peace with themselves, isn’t that kind of the point? All life is to attain a sense of peace in what you do, wherever you go. 

This brings us to the future, where we go. In physics; mathematically, it is very well known that time is a constant variable. Time is always at a given instant and keeps changing – increasing. Time keeps moving, though time itself is a constant and that being a certain fact; the future is uncertain. The uncertainty of the future is something we should immediately accept off the bat to allow us to let our thought process be informed of what we must expect. The introspection of the future is the planning of the desires and goals we have built in the present, and how we conduct a gap analysis to reach this point in the future. The point in the future, where you have learnt and grown to be the individual you have visualized to become, therefore, introspection being the art of knowing who you are – in the past, the present and the future.  

The greatest and the most resilient introspective minds come from the wisest, the people who can have a conversation about their desires in a critical yet realistic manner with utmost knowledge and maturity. Your introspection, in a way, resembles your character and attitude. Introspection though a broad concept, can simply be defined to being the art of knowing who you are – in the past, the present and the future.
