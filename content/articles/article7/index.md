“One who looks to spot the glimmering of gold in a dump yard, is truly wealthy. ” There lies two sides of a story, the positive and the negative. Two different worlds, two different perspectives; Heaven and Hell. Negativity, the root problem to the mindset of a human brain which causes the suffering, deadlier than a plague, a problem which is the cause for the sorrow. One can change this by how a man works his thought process. Bring positivity, look for the gold in the trash and the happiness and lessons in a world of pain and resignation. This, as we call, is the Opposite Thinking Method. One shall only let their mind explore and look into the darkness before turning to the light for good with the lessons acquired from analyzing how the darkness came into place. Once you’re done with analyzing the negative side of the situation, you should not obsess and make an hyperbole of what had happened, the past is the past. The past is the history, the future is a mystery, but; the moment you have right now is a gift, that’s why its called “the present”. Unwrap the present, make the most of it. Let it be known in your mind that life is too short. One must make use of every moment with a smile. Display gratitude, show appreciation, make someone happier than they were moments before they met you. If you achieve that, you’ll be as rich as you can ever be.
