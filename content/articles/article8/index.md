One transient being, one dream, one life. You. This is your story. One must know that life is too short to let their dreams kneel to the pleasures. The short term pleasures, the distractions which cause you happiness for no longer than the suffering you may go through. Discipline, is standing up to these evils. No matter what kind, one mustn’t choose the lesser evil; lesser, greater, middling, its all the same. Pleasures drain your value in this universe, the precious seconds you could spend working on what you love or working on the betterment of yourself and your responsibility, your work, your practice, your living. The act of pushing past your comfort zone, avoiding to succumb to these toxins is what gives you the discipline to lead a happy life. A life which does not involve in dependence but instead, self-love and contempt. This all starts once you recognize your duty towards discipline. The discipline which pushes you to a better life for yourself, a life where you have conquered the short-term pleasures and instead begin to focus on the long-term contempt. A life richer than it could’ve ever been, if not for discipline. The art of doing what’s right for you, not what makes you happy.
