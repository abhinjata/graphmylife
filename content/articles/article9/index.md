Materialism is most prevalent in today’s generation of urbanization, the consumer market grows day-by-day and uncanny and obsessive consumer behavior is a new norm. Materialism is known to be a certain mindset in an individual’s brain in which he craves material possessions for his so-called ‘happiness’. There lies a severe error in this statement, the usage of the word ‘happiness’.  

Adhering to the wants of a materialistic tendency does not bring you true happiness, instead, it is pleasure that is received by the individual. When we correct this simple mistake, and narrow down our definition, we find answers to compelling questions. If we do classify that what we receive through materialistic actions such as – unnecessary spending on goods that are not required – as pleasure, we understand that pleasure is nothing but short-term happiness. Effectively, a dopamine hit. A dopamine hit which does not severe any major purpose to our years ahead and our true values as an individual. Such pleasures are most commonly also seen in habits like – smoking, drug usage, alcoholism, sex, etc. There arises a new question which can defend materialism as a lesser evil; if I associated short-term happiness or ‘pleasure’ to alcoholism when alcoholism is breaking the balance between proper alcohol consumption, who said anything about materialism breaking any balance?  

Materialism breaks every balance. Ofcourse, the proper consumption of alcohol or tobacco can have minimal effects and arguably it is true that balancing these bad habits is not a cardinal sin to our life. But, speak of the balance of materialism – Materialism, is a way of life for most people. People are addicted to living an extravagant and flamboyant life, this breaks the entire argument of materialism being the lesser evil. Materialism is an evil which cannot stop.  

If we bring ourselves back to the meaning of pleasure, what is the solution? How can we not chase a life of pleasure and materialism? If pleasure is short-term happiness, what we seek is long-term happiness. To live a life away from a materialistic mindset and instead work activities which bring us long-term happiness and peace.  

By working on ourselves, keeping in mind our goals for the future and the individual we wish to become, it’ll bring us peace to achieve the goals that truly matter and push us towards becoming the ideal version of ourselves. By choosing to invest our time in pleasures, we throw away the prospect of true happiness and peace. By working on ourselves and keeping our mental image of the ideal version of ourselves always in tact, we can become more.
